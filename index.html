                The time I spent in WACSI as an intern from January to July 2013 was a memorable one for me as it was rich in experience sharing and helped me discover my potential. 
                I have had so many rich experiences and opportunities that I personally believe will forever shape and influence my professional life while fostering personal growth and development. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In this report, I hope to highlight the enormous opportunities offered by WACSI to young people from various countries in West Africa wishing to pursue a career in the domain of Civil Society.

                 In my desire to write this report, I have in no way any claim to come out with a perfect piece of work. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                These few details lead me to realize that, like all human endeavours, this report is not perfect and may contain errors and shortcomings.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Thus, I remain open to all criticisms and suggestions which could present me with new sources of inspiration as I develop in my ability to research and learn. 
                This report would not have been possible without the contribution and collaboration of others. My sincere gratitude: 
            </p>
